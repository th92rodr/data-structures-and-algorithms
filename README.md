# Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Tower of Hanoi Problem

[Solution \o/](https://github.com/Thiago92Rodrigues/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/tower-of-hanoi.py)

The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized as Towers) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

With `3 disks`, the puzzle can be solved in `7 moves`. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is `2^n âˆ’ 1`, where `n` is the number of disks.

## Recursive Staircase

[Solution \o/](https://github.com/Thiago92Rodrigues/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/recursive-staircase.py)

There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either `1` or `2` stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.

In a second version of this problem is passed a set with all the possible stairs climb the person can climb at a time, for example: `[1, 3, 5]` the person can climb `1` or `3` or `5` stairs at a time.

## Conflicting Appointments

[Solution \o/](https://github.com/Thiago92Rodrigues/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/find-conflicting-appointments.py)

Given `n` appointments, find all the conflicting ones.

Examples:
```
Input - Appointments: 
[ 10 to 11 ]
[ 8 to 9 ]
[ 12 to 13 ]
[ 12.2 to 12.5 ]
[ 8.5 to 9.5 ]
[ 2 to 4 ]
[ 10.5 to 12.5 ]
[ 3.5 to 8.5 ]

Output - Conflicting appointments: 
[ 12.2 to 12.5 ] with [ 12 to 13 ]
[ 8.5 to 9.5 ] with [ 8 to 9 ]
[ 10.5 to 12.5 ] with [ 10 to 11 ]
[ 10.5 to 12.5 ] with [ 12 to 13 ]
[ 3.5 to 8.5 ] with [ 8 to 9 ]
[ 3.5 to 8.5 ] with [ 2 to 4 ]
```

## Dictionary Implementation

[Solution \o/](https://github.com/Thiago92Rodrigues/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/dictionary-implementation.py)

Implement a dictionary using a `Trie` such that if the input is a string representing a word, the program prints its meaning from the prebuilt dictionary.
