## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements are linked using pointers.

A linked list is like a chain of nodes, where each node contains information like data and a pointer to the succeeding node in the chain. There’s a head pointer, which points to the first element of the linked list, and if the list is empty then it simply points to null or nothing.

Types of linked lists:

- Singly Linked List (Unidirectional)
- Doubly Linked List (Bi-directional)

Basic operations of linked lists:

- InsertAtEnd — Inserts given element at the end of the linked list
- InsertAtHead — Inserts given element at the start/head of the linked list
- Delete — Deletes given element from the linked list
- DeleteAtHead — Deletes first element of the linked list
- Search — Returns the given element from a linked list

### Algorithms:

- Reverse a linked list
- Get the kth node from the end of the list
- Detect loop
- Remove duplicates
