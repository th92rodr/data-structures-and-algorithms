## Binary Search Tree Data Structure

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

### Algorithms:

- Find the kth minimum value in a BST
- Find the tree height
- Find the lowest common ancestor between two nodes
- Get nodes at k distance from root
- Get a given node ancestors
